			<p> OCTOBER 4TH: Today in comp sci we pratciced getting our websites online. I am currently trying to get a camera as my background and it isn't really working. I uploaded a link to my journal. </p>

	<p> OCTOBER 7TH: Today I really tried to work on formatting my website. I changed the font in the journals. </p> 

	<p> OCTOBER 14TH: Today I worked on backgrounds and deciding the different ways I would organize themes for my website. I changed by website theme from pastels to something revolving more around space because I found a space theme more interesting. I changed the background to one of space and began adding in a rocket ship div to use almost as a guide for the website. I uploaded my person card online. </p>


	<p> OCTOBER 17TH: Today I added more sections to the website and created links and backgrounds for the "about me" and "projects" pages. </p>

	<p> OCTOBER 18TH: Today in class we worked on css animations. We began our projects in groups/pairs. Today we just got our ideas down and will continue to work on it as homework. </p>
	
	<p> OCTOBER 18TH: At home I finished my css animation by adding two different divs instead of attempting to seperate one. I had the head move up and down and it is an infinite loop of that animation. </p>
