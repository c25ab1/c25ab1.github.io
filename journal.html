	<p> MY JOURNAL ENTRIES:</p>

			<p> OCTOBER 4TH: Today in comp sci we pratciced getting our websites online. I am currently trying to get a camera as my background and it isn't really working. I uploaded a link to my journal. </p>

	<p> OCTOBER 7TH: Today I really tried to work on formatting my website. I changed the font in the journals. </p> 

	<p> OCTOBER 14TH: Today I worked on backgrounds and deciding the different ways I would organize themes for my website. I changed by website theme from pastels to something revolving more around space because I found a space theme more interesting. I changed the background to one of space and began adding in a rocket ship div to use almost as a guide for the website. I uploaded my person card online. </p>


	<p> OCTOBER 17TH: Today I added more sections to the website and created links and backgrounds for the "about me" and "projects" pages. In class we worked on css animations. We began our projects in groups/pairs. Today we just got our ideas down and will continue to work on it as homework -> At home I finished my css animation by adding two different divs instead of attempting to seperate one. I had the head move up and down and it is an infinite loop of that animation. </p>


	<p>NOVEMBER 1ST: In class today we continued to learn about Javascript. Javascript requires a different type of code but there are many connections that I can see across CSS and Java. Unlike CSS, where there are bodied sections, in Javascript, each line of code gives directions of what 'section' to go to. For example, instead of creating a style section, you would type out variable.style. We also learned about variables and functions.Functions are something you are creating, like a recipe, to do something that the computer will continuously refer back to. A variable is similar to a div in CSS. A variable is a named object that can then be modified as an image, text, shape, etc. We also learned about the different ways to display code in Javscript. There is the web display and the console log display and depending on where your variable is told to show, your function will be run there. Getting to know the vocabulary in javascript is fairly similar to thr basic vocabulary in CSS but there are also terms such as 'appendChild'that do not show up in CSS. </p>

	<p> DEC 4TH: Today I worked on my "how it works" presentation. I am working on a slideshow about Facial Recognition Software and the technology behind it. This topic ntrigued me because most people use this technology everyday, through their phones, but also without knowing. What was interesting was the fact that unkowingly, many people around the world are having their faces recorded and scanned daily. I also connected this presentation to the one about issues with pieces of technology. I started my research by trying to figure out how the US military uses facial recognition software, then moved globaly, and ended up specifically focusing in China. The reason China's use of this technology interested me so much is because it was revealed that this technology was used to not only target minorities (like in the US), it was used to support the genocide of Uyghur Muslims in the country. 
	I also want to maybe add animations to the homepage of my website if I find time before everything is due. </p>

	<p> DEC 6TH: Today in class we were putting the finishing touches on our websites. Our websites and projects are due soon. I finaly finished my praticing with arrays project - which was the "What My Little Pony character are you?" generator. I know it is not ideal for the outcome of that project to be random but, maybe in the future, I can work to eiter add onto that project or create a new one where the result is based off of a quiz. Today I also had a lab with Molly. We were struggling to figure out why the image formatting and divs were not working on that project and after a VERY long time, we figured out that the arrays in the begining were switched, which messed up the rest of the project. I also pushed my website, but I am unsure if it worked because I am getting error notifications from GitHub. </p>
